Introduction:
Welcome to the Multiplication Game, a strategic challenge implemented in MIPS assembly language. This game involves a 6x6 grid where players select numbers to multiply, aiming to create a sequence of four in a row, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

Objective:

Starting the Game:

●	The computer responds by calculating its move, multiplying its choice by the player's number.
●	The board updates after each turn to reflect the new product, with ‘0’ displaying on each tile the player has selected & ‘X’ displaying on each tile that the computer has selected.

Winning Conditions:
●	The game continues until a player successfully forms a sequence of four numbers in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
●	The player or computer achieving this sequence is declared the winner.
